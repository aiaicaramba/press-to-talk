A comprehensive project outline for the "Innovative Agro Escape Challenge" involves dividing the 4-week duration into phases and assigning roles accordingly to leverage students' skills in alignment with learning outcomes LO3 and LO4. Here is a proposed team structure:


1. Research Phase (Weeks 1-2):

   - **Researcher**: Students are tasked with conducting market research on the demand for educational escape room games, identifying key components of modern farming technologies, and understanding gamification principles in education. They will also gather insights into user experience requirements for both entertainment value and educational content.

   - **Presenter**: The presenter compiles a report outlining the research findings, which includes potential game mechanics that integrate agriculture-related challenges, target audience demographics, and technology trends to inform design decisions.


2. Design Phase (Weeks 3-4):

   - **Designer**: This role involves creating the narrative, puzzles, educational content, and technological prototypes for IoT devices used within the game environment. They will ensure that each element is engaging, informative, and relevant to sustainable farming practices.

   - **Analysis**: The analysis team collaborates with the designer to assess the feasibility of their designs using data visualization tools like Figma for wireframes and augmented reality SDKs to simulate experiences before realization. They also identify potential cybersecurity concerns, adhering to industry best practices as evaluated through Wireshark network analyses.
 Writers have access to SQL databases (for managing the game's puzzle solutions) and HTML/CSS for creating user interfaces that are intuitive and accessible.

3. Realisation Phase (Week 4):

   - **Developer**: The developers work on bringing the design specifications to life, coding IoT devices, integrating AI-driven storytelling elements, augmented reality features, and ensuring all interactive technologies are functioning as intended. They utilize AWS IoT Core for real-time interactions between devices and an SQL database management system for storing puzzle data.

   - **Tester**: The testing team works alongside developers to rigorously test the game's functionalities, including any bugs or security vulnerabilities uncovered during development. They prepare documentation on their findings and ensure that all technologies are compatible with existing platforms used by Everlast Agro B.V. for broader accessibility.


The final product will be a fully realized escape room game presented to FEI in collaboration with Everlast Agro B.V., showcasing the integration of ICT into entertainment and education, specifically focused on engaging younger audiences in agricultural careers.
