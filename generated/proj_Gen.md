** The comprehensive challenge task involves designing an innovative marine sensor network conceptual framework that utilizes cutting-edge underwater acoustic communication technology to enable real-time, secure environmental monitoring and data analytics. This framework includes a prototype interface mockup created using Figma, depicting user interaction with the system alongside robust cybersecurity protocols; an Arduino-based hardware interfacing simulation within a VMWare virtualized environment illustrating how sensor networks operate underwater and exchange data while maintaining high levels of security against potential threats. Throughout this process, students will focus on different project components during each phase: Analysis for research insights, Design to translate concepts into practical designs, and Realisation to simulate the functionality in a controlled setting, all within 4 weeks. The end product demonstrates how ICT can significantly enhance oceanic data collection, analysis, and environmental protection efforts while ensuring cybersecurity is an integral part of these advanced technological solutions.
