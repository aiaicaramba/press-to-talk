## Theme: Enhancing Greenhouse Management through IT Solutions

The Soccer Innovators Project Challenge focuses on designing a wearable technology platform to improve player performance analytics within the realm of soccer. By leveraging student expertise in ICT, this project will enable participants to create innovative solutions that blend sports science with cutting-edge IT capabilities. The goal is to produce an engaging and practical application for athletes at various levels, from school teams to professional leagues.

Students are tasked with conceptualizing a system comprised of wearable sensors and IoT devices that capture real-time data on player performance metrics such as speed, agility, heart rate, and fatigue levels. This initiative aligns with the company's interest in leveraging technology for enhancing athletic performance while maintaining privacy and security standards.

## Project Description:

The students will work in teams to develop a prototype wearable tech platform that integrates data from various sensors worn by players during training or matches, providing insights into their physical condition, technique improvements, and potential areas for development. The project encompasses multiple stages of the ICT process, including analysis (identifying key performance indicators), design (creating a user-friendly interface and data visualization tools), realisation (building the prototype using Arduino and other hardware components), and implementation (integrating analytics into sports training regimes).

The challenge is divided into two parts:
1. Designing and developing the wearable technology platform, with an emphasis on interoperability between different devices and platforms for data collection and analysis. This includes selecting appropriate sensors, designing a compact form factor for comfort during play, and ensuring robust connectivity options to transmit data securely.
2. Crafting an interactive dashboard that translates the collected sensor data into actionable insights using graphical representations like charts and heatmaps. The platform should support collaboration among coaches, players, and analysts by providing a centralized location for accessing performance metrics and historical trends, ultimately enhancing player development strategies while maintaining user privacy.

## Main Question:

How can we integrate wearable technology with soccer training programs to deliver personalized insights into athlete performance and foster improvement?

## Possible Product:

A working prototype of the wearable tech platform, including an intuitive dashboard that presents real-time player metrics in a user-friendly manner. This might include mobile applications or web interfaces accessible through various devices to facilitate collaboration between athletes, coaches, and analysts during training sessions and post-game reviews.

## Constraints:

- Project duration is limited to 4 weeks.
- Students must select specific aspects of the project (Analysis, Design, or Realisation) for in-depth exploration.
- The server infrastructure provided by the school's IT department will be utilized during development and testing phases.

## Possible Tools/Technology:

Students may leverage Figma for interface design, Arduino microcontroller boards for hardware integration, programming languages like C# or embedded C for system software, SQL databases for data management, CSS/HTML for web interfaces, Wireshark for network monitoring, and virtualization tools to simulate different environments during development.

This challenge aayerly aligns with Fontys ICT educational principles by providing an engaging context that combines technical expertise with the students' passion for sports, while developing practical IT skills essential in today's job market.
