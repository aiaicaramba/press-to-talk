Challenge Description:

The challenge revolves around the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of journalism. Your task is to design and develop an AI system that can automate certain aspects of journalism such as data collection, story writing or even analysing reader response. 

Challenge Stages:

1. Research: Understand the current state of AI in journalism. Identify areas where AI can bring about a significant change. This could be anything from data-driven journalism, automated content creation, personalization of content, etc. 

2. Planning: Create a detailed plan of your AI system. This should include the specific journalism task the AI will automate, the AI technologies to be used (like Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, etc.), and how the system will interact with journalists and readers.

3. Development: Develop your AI system using relevant AI tools and techniques. Make sure to adhere to best AI development practices.

4. Testing: Test your AI system to ensure it works as expected. Make necessary adjustments based on the results of your tests.

5. Presentation: Present your AI system to the class. Describe the journalism task your system automates, how it interacts with journalists and readers, and how it revolutionizes the field of journalism.

Ethical Considerations: 

As you work on your system, consider the ethical implications, including data privacy and bias in AI. Ensure your system adheres to relevant data privacy laws and best practices in AI ethics. 

Your challenge is to not only develop a functional AI system but also one that respects the rights of its users and operates ethically. 

Good luck with your challenge!
