The Greenhouse Management System project is designed to address the complexities of modern greenhouse operations by integrating technology and innovation across five interconnected layers. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive enhancement of greenhouse management practices, focusing on efficiency, sustainability, and data-driven decision-making. 

This foundational layer involves the deployment of sensors within the greenhouse environment to monitor vital parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The selection and integration of these sensors with hardware platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi  are crucial for accurate real-time data collection, forming the basis for all subsequent analysis and optimisation efforts.

Building upon the hardware layer, this aspect focuses on the creation of a robust and scalable network infrastructure that facilitates the efficient and secure transmission of collected data. The design of this network is critical to ensuring that data flows seamlessly from the sensors to a database for processing server-client communication for reliable solutions.
    
With the hardware in place and data being transmitted effectively, this layer emphasizes the development of specialized software to process and analyze the incoming data. The software interprets the sensor data to extract actionable insights, enabling precise monitoring and management of the greenhouse environment.
    
Create on- and offline promotional material to make clients of Agro BV aware of our solutions.  Think about interactive prototypes, websites, mobile applications, video, posters in an iterative way. Create for example a marketing campaign, explaining the advantages, and how to use, our product, directed to customers of the company. Another option is a campaign directed to young people, in order to motivate them to find a job in a Greenhouse. 

This layer of the project focuses on ensuring the reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of the Greenhouse Management System. Through comprehensive testing, the system is refined and optimised to address any issues and improve performance. Additionally, an analysis of the system's sustainability and economic impact is conducted to ensure that the solutions implemented not only enhance operational efficiency but also contribute positively to environmental sustainability and profitability in the long term.
    

By addressing some of these layers (at least three) the Greenhouse Management System project aims to improve greenhouse management practices, leveraging cutting-edge technology to create a more efficient, sustainable, and data-driven approach to cultivation.

## Project description

This project focuses on creating a scalable and sustainable management system for greenhouses. It involves several parts of the Field of IT. Students are invited to make their own choices and tailer-made this project. The project is structured to allow students to choose their focus areas, tailoring the learning experience to their interests and career aspirations. Based on the chosen focus areas all the learning outcomes are assessed. 

## Main question

How can IT solutions be integrated into greenhouse operations to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and profitability?

## Possible product

A working prototype of the greenhouse management system, maybe a website  or mobile app for monitoring the processes. You can also think about data visualisation to make the data human readable. 

## Constraints

- The project duration is limited to 4 weeks.
- Students must choose several parts to focus on during the project, using Analysis, Design, Realisation.
- The server used for the project could be located in the net lab (VMWare).

## Possible tools/technology

- Figma, wireframe, Arduino, embedded C, SQL, C#, HTML, CSS, VS Code, Wireshark, virtualisation tools.
