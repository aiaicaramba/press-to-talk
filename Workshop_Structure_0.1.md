**Workshops, inspiration, and information sessions**

Workshops should be how it sounds. This means not so much a classical
lesson but more a moment that students are active in a (pre) structured
way and work with a certain focus on a learning issue. On the other
hand, for some issues something like an information session is needed.,
for example, how does our assessment structure work, or orientation
sessions with higher years students etc. There is also the need for
inspiration sessions to trigger and surprise students. In this document
the workshops have the highlight, but there is a need to also address
these other forms.

> **Inspiration sessions** are more to tickle students' imagination, let
> them think or aww them, with the goal of aiding their orientation on
> the broad field of ICT. This needs no preparation from the students
> other than an open mindset. It can be showcases, future visions, new
> developments etc. (Good idea to activate our partners for this.)
>
> **Information sessions,** have more to spread how things are done and
> organised and have a dialog about it. There is a lot to take in for
> new students so a more central dialog (apart from what the coaches do)
> is meaningful and more efficient. For example how does Canvas work.
> How do assessments work etc.

**Workshops**

> The idea behind workshops is that the students work! So, it shouldn't
> have the for of a classical lesson in which the students just consumes
> what is being presented. The idea is to let the students prepare
> themselves and come to he workshop prepared.

-   **Preparation,** Every workshop should have a description of how
    students should prepare themselves. This can be as simple as reading
    something and have questions or create or build something that wil
    be used as vehicle to work in the workshop. **Every workshop in the
    canvas course should have such a paragraph.** For the students this
    can be an artifact for their portfolio especially if they have done
    something with it in the workshop and reflect on it in terms of
    learning and orientation.

> **Executing a workshop** means that something will be done with the
> preparation of the students. Students must be informed of what this is
> to let them decide if the workshop will be meaningful for them. To
> cater for this every workshop description should also have a paragraph
> which describes **what will be done with the student's preparation**.
>
> It should also give the students an opportunity to create an portfolio
> artefact. Possibilities for the creation of such an artefact will also
> be described in the course. As will be the need to ad some reflection
> to the artefact.
>
> **Wrapup**. When a workshop comes too an end, the students are
> actively informed about possible next steps. These will also be made
> available in de canvas course.

    -   Required preparation (What should a student do before the
